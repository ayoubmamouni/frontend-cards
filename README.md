Simple responsive project cards

if you wanna make edit in 'scss' files you need to install sass using NPM

```
npm install -g sass
```

Run this command on CMD as administrator ..
Or if you are using MACINTOSH Run this command

```
sudo npm install -g sass
```

then type this command and run it

```
sass --watch styles/style.scss css/site.css
```

There is an extension in VS code colled **Watch Sass** use it if you don't like CLI :)

or simply edit in **site.css** file, find it in **css** folder.
